Subjective-C compiler

What is this?
 This is a "compiler". It comments on your code - subjectively. (Or as subjectively as a computer is able to.)
 It gives useless feedback and annoys you.

WHY is this?
 I created this after making this (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/uwxi9l/subjectivec/) meme for reddit.
 There is no other reason for this thing to exist.

Can I compile this myself?
 Yes, you'll actually have to. For Windows, there is a "make.bat" included; however you are still gonna need to have gcc in your path.
 In theory, you should be able to give the main.c to pretty much any standard C99-compiler and it should work.

For licensing (why would you?), see the LICENSE.

I hope I destroyed your day with this.
